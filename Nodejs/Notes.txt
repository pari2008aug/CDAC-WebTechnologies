Nodejs is a Out of browser JS platform where U can execute JS code like a server side Environment. U can run the JS from a terminal of UR OS. U can develop server side code as well as develop web apps with little infrastructure.
U can create JS apps like File read/write, database access, socket programming, web applications and many more. 
Nodejs has its own community that provides ready to use libraries or packages for App development other than what the nodejs in its installation provides. It is called NPM(Node Package Manager). With NPM, all major JS Frameworks are exported thru NODEJS only. All JS Frameworks like Angular, React, Vue.js will ship their Frameworks code on Nodejs. 
Nodejs can sit on any OS like Windows, Linux, MacOs etc. 
It uses the Chrome's V8 JS Engine to execute the Js code out of the browser. This platform was developed by Ryan Dahl working for Joyant Technologies. Now Nodejs is completely owned and supported by Joyant Technologies. 
U can use Command prompt to execute any JS Code thru nodejs. 

How Nodejs Works?
Nodejs runs on V8 Engine of Chrome so that U can run JS code from UR environment instead of a browser. The Environment is created in the location folder of the Nodejs installation and an Environment variable Path is set to allow node access from anywhere in ur machine. 
Nodejs runs a single threaded Application that performs a REPL activity using messages sent by the OS. Read, Evaluate, Print Loop will perform the operations in a single threaded environment until the user terminates the application. 
However, Nodejs performs async programming. It uses callback function mechanism. CallBack functions are functions that are invoked using async mechanims of using internal threads of the browser. JS Runtime will use background threads using Thread Pool. A Pool of threads readily available for the executing app to consume it without a need to create an explicit thread is what is called as THREAD POOL. Nodejs uses the thread pool to make async calls. Nodejs uses explicitly these Async functions to perform its API calls including DB Access, File IO, REST Services  and many more. 
Nodejs is a non blocking Single Threaded Environment. The App is not designed to wait for any user interaction. UR prompt, alert messages dont work in nodejs.
